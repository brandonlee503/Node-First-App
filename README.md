# Node-First-App

My first app with Node.js which consists of an instagram popular photos viewer.

This is a simple app that utilizes many web technologies to do the following:

- Process JS file with node
- Use npm to initilize, install, and run projects
- Create an HTTP server with Node and Express
- Used a package to grab API data
- Templated an application with EJS
- Displayed data with EJS
